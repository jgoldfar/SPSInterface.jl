% Subsubsections are not currently parsed to deduce any structure
% of the data. Support for this functionality may be added later.
% For now, these read as regular Markdown sections, allowing
% documentation to be added as plain text.
### Couenne Solver
% For example, we may set paths:
ExecutablePath /usr/local/bin/couenne

### Bonmin Solver
ExecutablePath /usr/local/bin/bonmin

% Note: Making all availability sections consecutive seems
% to be preferable, but employees placed in multiple such
% sections will be parsed in order.
